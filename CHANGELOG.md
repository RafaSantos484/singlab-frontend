# Changelog

All notable changes to the SingLab Frontend will be documented in this file.

## [Unreleased]

### Changed
- **Simplified GlobalPlayer architecture**: Removed complex barrier-based
  synchronization with ticket system, eliminated periodic drift-correction
  intervals, and removed automatic rebuffering logic. Now uses simpler
  pre-play synchronization with play attempt tracking.
- **Improved controls UX**: All player controls (play, pause, stop, seek, volume,
  source toggle, stem selection) are disabled during loading/buffering phase,
  preventing user interactions during initialization.
- **Stabilized multi-track playback**: Fixed race condition on mobile devices
  where cached audio would start playing silently. Now uses 50ms readiness delay
  and dual synchronization when switching between raw and separated sources.
- **Refactored to single global player architecture**: Replaced per-card audio
  players with a unified `GlobalPlayer` component at the bottom of the dashboard.

### Removed
- **Legacy per-card player components**: `SongPlayer` and `CustomAudioPlayer`
  components removed in favor of the single global player.
- **AudioManager singleton**: No longer needed with single audio element approach.
- **useAudioState hook**: Replaced with simpler event listeners in `GlobalPlayer`.

### Added

#### Stem Separation Feature
- **Stem separation API client** (`lib/api/separations.ts`) — Typed API wrapper
  for separation operations (`requestSeparation`, `refreshSeparationStatus`).
- **`useSeparationStatus` hook** — Manages the complete separation lifecycle:
  submission, automatic polling (5s intervals), status normalization, and error
  handling. Integrates with Firestore real-time updates for separation status.
- **Separation adapter pattern** (`lib/separations/`) — Provider-agnostic
  normalization layer for separation task data. Includes `PoyoSeparationAdapter`
  for normalizing PoYo provider responses into a unified schema. Extensible for
  additional providers.
- **`SongCardItem` component** — Extracted song card UI with separation status
  panel showing: request button (not started), progress bar with refresh (processing),
  available stems (finished), or error message with retry (failed).
- **GlobalPlayer separation support** — Player now supports both raw and separated
  audio playback:
  - Playback source toggle (Raw vs. Separated)
  - Multiple synced `<audio>` elements for separated stems
  - Stem selection UI with toggleable chips
  - Preset mixes: Instrumental (all stems except vocals), Vocals only, All stems
  - Synchronized playhead and volume control across all stems
- **Song type updates** — Added `separatedSongInfo` field to `Song` type to store
  provider-specific separation task data. Updated Firestore synchronization to
  include separation status in real-time listener.

#### Other Additions
- **GlobalPlayer component** (`components/features/GlobalPlayer.tsx`) — Single
  persistent audio player with play/pause/stop controls, progress bar with seek,
  volume control, and responsive design. Displays currently playing song metadata.
- **Player actions in global state**: `PLAYER_LOAD_SONG`, `PLAYER_SET_STATUS`,
  and `PLAYER_STOP` actions for controlling global playback.
- **useGlobalStateDispatch hook** — Allows components to dispatch actions to
  global state.
- **"Now Playing" indicator** — Song cards show a visual badge when playing and
  are pinned to the top of the filtered list.
- **SongDeleteButton component** — Reusable button for deleting songs with
  confirmation dialog, loading state, and comprehensive error handling (401, 403,
  404, network failures). Includes full accessibility features.
- Added `@mui/lab` dependency for additional Material-UI components.
- Design token palette (`brand-*`, `accent-*`) defined via Tailwind v4 `@theme`
  block in `app/globals.css`, replacing the former neutral `zinc` colors. Tokens
  are available as utility classes project-wide.
- Login page refactored with a purple/blue futuristic theme matching the app
  brand: ambient glows, glassmorphism card, gradient CTA button, inline SVG
  logo, waveform and spectrum decorations.
- Login page: added **"Forgot password?"** and **"Create new account"** mock
  buttons (UI only; respective flows not yet implemented).
- `lib/hooks/useSongRawUrl` — custom hook that checks `rawSongInfo.urlInfo.expiresAt`
  and proactively refreshes the signed URL via `GET /songs/:songId/raw/url` when
  within 5 minutes of expiry. Caches the refreshed URL locally for immediate
  playback; subsequent Firestore-pushed updates are picked up automatically.
- Dashboard: Play buttons on song cards trigger global player playback.
- Dashboard: each song card now includes a delete button for removing songs.
